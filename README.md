# PyClasher

---

pyclasher is the name of the asynchronous ClashOfClans API. It is
an object-oriented wrapper client that provides easy access to the 
requested data.

---

The package is still in development and will be finished as short as
possible for me. When the package covers the 
whole ClashOfClans API, the repository will be transformed into
a python package and will be available for everyone. 

If you have any questions, feel free to join my discord server 
to ask you question.

### Features
 - Asynchronous and parallel requesting
 - Possibility to use multiple tokens and to login via email address 
and password of the ClashOfClans developer portal
 - Control over the number of requests per second and the number of 
used tokens
 - Open source
 - Documented and type hinted

---

### Future

I'm planning to keep the API wrapper up to date and improve it as
good as I can. 

If you find a bug, an error or want custom functionality, please tell
me via Discord or open an issue or start a discussion on the 
GitHub-repository.
