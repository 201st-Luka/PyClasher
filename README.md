# PyClasher

---

py-clasher is the name of the asynchronous ClashOfClans API. It is
an object-oriented client that provides easy access to the 
requested data.

---

The package is still in development and will be finished in the 
shortest time that is possible for me. When the package covers the 
whole ClashOfClans API, the repository will be transformed into
a python package and will be available for everyone. 

If you have any questions, feel free to join my discord server 
to ask you question.
